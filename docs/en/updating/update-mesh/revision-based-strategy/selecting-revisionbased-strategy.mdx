# Selecting RevisionBased strategy

To deploy Istio with the `RevisionBased` strategy, create the `Istio` resource with the following `spec.updateStrategy` value:

**Example specification to select `RevisionBased` strategy**

```yaml
kind: Istio
spec:
  version: v1.28.3
  updateStrategy:
    type: RevisionBased
```

After you select the strategy for the Istio resource, the Operator creates a new `IstioRevision` resource with the name `<istio_resource_name>-<version>`.
