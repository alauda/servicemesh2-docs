# Deploying the Bookinfo Application

## An Overview of the Bookinfo Application

To install the `bookinfo` sample application, two primary steps are required: first, deploying the application itself, and second, setting up a gateway to make it accessible from outside the cluster.

The `bookinfo` application serves as a tool for exploring the features of a service mesh. It allows you to easily verify that web browser requests are correctly routed through the mesh to the application.

The `bookinfo` application presents information about a book, much like a single entry in an online bookstore's catalog. It shows a page with a book description, its details (such as ISBN and page count), and customer reviews.

When exposed through the mesh, the behavior of the `bookinfo` application's microservices is governed by the mesh configuration. The review data is sourced from one of three services: `reviews-v1`, `reviews-v2`, or `reviews-v3`. If you deploy `bookinfo` without a defined `reviews` virtual service, the mesh defaults to a round-robin policy for routing requests to these services.

By creating a `reviews` virtual service, you can define custom routing rules. For instance, you could configure the mesh to direct requests to the `reviews-v2` service when a user is logged in, which would display reviews with black stars. Conversely, for users who are not logged in, the mesh could route requests to `reviews-v3`, showing reviews with red stars.

Additional details can be found in the upstream Istio documentation for the [Bookinfo Application](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/).

## Deploying the Bookinfo Application

### Prerequisites

  - Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator is installed.
  - An Istio CNI is deployed.
  - An Istio control plane is deployed.

### Procedure

1.  Use the following command to Create a new namespace named `bookinfo`:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace bookinfo
    ```


2.  Enable sidecar injection for the `bookinfo` namespace. If your setup uses the `InPlace` upgrade strategy, run this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
    ```

    <Directive type="note">

    If you are using the `RevisionBased` upgrade strategy, execute these commands:

    1.  To discover your `<revision-name>`, run the following:

        ```shell
        kubectl get istiorevisions.sailoperator.io
        ```

        **Sample output:**

        ```shell
        NAME      NAMESPACE      PROFILE   READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
        default   istio-system             True    Healthy   True     v1.28.1   47h
        ```

    2.  Label the namespace using the revision name to enable sidecar injection:

        ```shell
        kubectl label namespace bookinfo istio.io/rev=default
        ```
    
    </Directive>


3.  *Optional* : If you have already configured `discoverySelectors`, use the following command to apply the Istio `discovery selector` to the `bookinfo` namespace:

    **Example `discovery selector` label**: `istio-discovery=enabled`
    
    ```shell
    kubectl label namespace bookinfo istio-discovery=enabled
    ```

4.  Deploy the `bookinfo` application by applying its YAML file with the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
    ```

### Verification

1.  To confirm the `bookinfo` service is available, run this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get services -n bookinfo
    ```

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
    details       ClusterIP   10.4.153.200   <none>        9080/TCP   4m44s
    productpage   ClusterIP   10.4.132.101   <none>        9080/TCP   4m43s
    ratings       ClusterIP   10.4.76.104    <none>        9080/TCP   4m44s
    reviews       ClusterIP   10.4.48.38     <none>        9080/TCP   4m44s
    ```

2.  To check that the `bookinfo` pods are available, execute the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-c66556f6d-bbqjx        2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    productpage-v1-5f568ff46d-r886k   2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    ratings-v1-74bcfcb96d-7bm8s       2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    reviews-v1-549bfb5f44-xwh4z       2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    reviews-v2-6486bc9868-snch4       2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    reviews-v3-6c66dc6cdd-87jgd       2/2     Running   0          5m56s
    ```

    A successful proxy sidecar injection is indicated when the `Ready` column shows `2/2`. Ensure the `Status` column for each pod shows `Running`.

3.  Confirm the `bookinfo` application is running by sending a request to its `product page`. Execute this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=ratings -n bookinfo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c ratings -n bookinfo -- curl -sS productpage:9080/productpage | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
    ```

    **Example output**

    ```html
    <title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
    ```

## Accessing the Bookinfo Application via a Gateway

Gateways are not deployed by the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator because they are not considered part of the control plane. For security, it is a best practice to deploy Ingress and Egress gateways in a separate namespace from the control plane.

There are two methods for deploying gateways: [using the Gateway API](../../../gateways/directing-traffic-into-the-mesh/exposing-a-service-via-k8s-gateway-api.mdx) or [the gateway injection technique](../../../gateways/gateway-installation/installing-a-gateway-via-injection.mdx).

### Accessing the Bookinfo Application with Istio Gateway Injection

The gateway injection technique leverages the same mechanism as Istio sidecar injection. It creates a gateway from a `Deployment` resource that is associated with a `Service` resource. This `Service` can then be exposed outside the Alauda Container Platform cluster.

#### Prerequisites

  - Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator is installed.
  - An Istio control plane is deployed.

#### Procedure

1.  Execute the following command to create the `istio-ingressgateway` deployment and service:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/refs/heads/main/chart/samples/ingress-gateway.yaml
    ```

2.  Configure the `bookinfo` application to use the newly created gateway by running this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
    ```

    :::note
    This example uses a sample gateway configuration file to set up gateway injection for the `bookinfo` application. The file must be applied in the same namespace where the application is installed.
    :::

3.  *Optional* : Modify the YAML file for automatic pod scaling based on ingress traffic.

    **Example configuration**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
    metadata:
      labels:
        istio: ingressgateway
        release: istio
      name: ingressgatewayhpa
      namespace: bookinfo
    spec:
      minReplicas: 2
      maxReplicas: 5  # [!code callout]
      metrics:
        - resource:
            name: cpu
            target:
              averageUtilization: 80
              type: Utilization
          type: Resource
      scaleTargetRef:
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        name: istio-ingressgateway
    ```

    <Callouts>
      1. In this example, the maximum replica count is set to `5` and the minimum to `2`. A new replica is created when CPU utilization hits 80%.
    </Callouts>

4.  *Optional* : Define the minimum number of pods that should be running on the node.

    **Example configuration**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: policy/v1
    kind: PodDisruptionBudget
    metadata:
      labels:
        istio: ingressgateway
        release: istio
      name: ingressgatewaypdb
      namespace: bookinfo
    spec:
      minAvailable: 1  # [!code callout]
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          istio: ingressgateway
    ```

    <Callouts>
      1. This example configuration makes sure at least one replica is running if a pod is restarted on a different node.
    </Callouts>

#### Verification

You will connect to the Bookinfo `productpage` service through the gateway you just provisioned. To access the gateway, you need to use the `kubectl port-forward` command:

```shell
kubectl -n bookinfo port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway 9080:80
```

- If you run the command locally on your workstation, open `http://localhost:9080/productpage` in your browser.  
- If you ran the command on a remote **IPv4** host and used `--address "0.0.0.0"`, replace `localhost` with the remote host's IP or hostname (for example `http://<REMOTE_HOST_IP>:9080/productpage`)
- If you ran the command on a remote **IPv6** host and used `--address "::"`, replace `localhost` with the remote host's IP or hostname (for example `http://[<REMOTE_HOST_IP>]:9080/productpage`)

When you refresh the page several times, you should see different versions of reviews shown in `productpage`, presented in a round robin style (red stars, black stars, no stars), since we haven't yet used Istio to control the version routing.

### Accessing the Bookinfo Application with the Gateway API

With the Kubernetes Gateway API, a gateway is deployed through the creation of a `Gateway` resource.

#### Prerequisites

  - Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator is installed.
  - An Istio control plane is deployed.
  - Your Kubernetes cluster supports external load balancers (i.e., Services of type `LoadBalancer`)

#### Procedure

1.  Create and configure a gateway with the `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` resources by executing the command below:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/bookinfo/gateway-api/bookinfo-gateway.yaml 
    ```

    :::note
    This example uses a sample gateway configuration file to configure a gateway for the `bookinfo` application via the Gateway API. This file must be applied in the application's namespace.
    :::

3.  Ensure the Gateway API service is ready and has an address by running the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl wait --for=condition=programmed gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo
    ```

4.  Retrieve the host with this command:

    ```shell
    export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
    echo "INGRESS_HOST=$INGRESS_HOST"
    ```

5.  Retrieve the port with this command:

    ```shell
    export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl get gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo -o jsonpath='{.spec.listeners[?(@.name=="http")].port}')
    echo "INGRESS_PORT=$INGRESS_PORT"
    ```

6.  Retrieve the gateway URL with this command:

    :::info
    If `$INGRESS_HOST` is an IPv6 address, enclose it in square brackets when constructing the URL. For example:

    ```shell
    export GATEWAY_URL=[$INGRESS_HOST]:$INGRESS_PORT
    ```
    :::

    ```shell
    export GATEWAY_URL=$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT
    ```

7.  Get the full URL for the product page by running the following command:

    ```shell
    echo "http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage"
    ```

#### Verification

  - Confirm that the **productpage** is accessible with the `curl` command:
    
    ```shell
    curl -sS -g "http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
    ```

    **Example output**

    ```html
    <title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
    ```

  - Confirm that the **productpage** is accessible in a web browser.

    Point your browser to `http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage` to view the Bookinfo web page.
    
    When you refresh the page several times, you should see different versions of reviews shown in `productpage`, presented in a round robin style (red stars, black stars, no stars), since we haven't yet used Istio to control the version routing.
