# Application Requirements

Many Kubernetes applications can be deployed in an Istio-enabled cluster without any changes at all. However, there are some implications of Istio's sidecar model that may need special consideration when deploying an Istio-enabled application. This document describes these application considerations and specific requirements of Istio enablement.

## Pod requirements

To be part of a mesh, Kubernetes pods must satisfy the following requirements:

- **Application UIDs**: Ensure your pods do **not** run applications as a user with the user ID (UID) value of `1337` because `1337` is reserved for the sidecar proxy.

- **Pod labels**: We recommend explicitly declaring pods with an application identifier and version by using a pod label. These labels add contextual information to the metrics and telemetry that Istio collects. Each of these values are read from multiple labels ordered from highest to lowest precedence:

    - Application name: `service.istio.io/canonical-name`, `app.kubernetes.io/name`, or `app`.
    - Application version: `service.istio.io/canonical-revision`, `app.kubernetes.io/version`, or `version`.

    :::warning
    **Kiali** relies on correctness of these labels for several features (particularly the **Application name** label).
    
    In Istio, it is possible to use a different set of labels, like `app.kubernetes.io/name` and `app.kubernetes.io/version`, however you must configure Kiali to the labels you are using. By default, Kiali uses Istio's recommended `app` and `version` labels.
    :::

- **Named service ports**: Service ports may optionally be named to explicitly specify a protocol. See [Protocol Selection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/protocol-selection/) for more details. If a pod belongs to multiple [Kubernetes services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), the services cannot use the same port number for different protocols, for instance HTTP and TCP.

## Ports used by Istio

The following ports and protocols are used by the Istio sidecar proxy (Envoy).

To avoid port conflicts with sidecars, applications should not use any of the ports used by Envoy.

| Port | Protocol | Description | Pod-internal only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15000 | TCP | Envoy admin port (commands/diagnostics) | Yes |
| 15001 | TCP | Envoy outbound | No |
| 15002 | TCP | Listen port for failure detection | Yes |
| 15004 | HTTP | Debug port | Yes |
| 15006 | TCP | Envoy inbound | No |
| 15008 | HTTP2 | HBONE mTLS tunnel port | No |
| 15020 | HTTP | Merged Prometheus telemetry from `Istio agent`, Envoy, and application | No |
| 15021 | HTTP | Health checks | No |
| 15053 | DNS | DNS port, if capture is enabled | Yes |
| 15090 | HTTP | Envoy Prometheus telemetry | No |
