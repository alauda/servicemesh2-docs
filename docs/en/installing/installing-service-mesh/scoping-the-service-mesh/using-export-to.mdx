# Using `exportTo`

Istio's `VirtualService`, `DestinationRule`, and `ServiceEntry` provide a `spec.exportTo` field. Similarly, `Service` can be configured with the `networking.istio.io/exportTo` annotation.

Unlike `Sidecar` which allows a workload owner to control what dependencies it has, `exportTo` works in the opposite way, and allows the service owners to control their own service's visibility.

For example, this configuration makes the `details` `Service` only visible to its own namespace, and the `client` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: details
  annotations:
    networking.istio.io/exportTo: ".,client"
spec: ...
```
