# Customizing Istio configuration

The `values` field of the `Istio` custom resource definition, which was created when the control plane was deployed,
can be used to customize Istio configuration using Istio's `Helm` configuration values.

**Procedure**

1. In the Alauda Container Platform web console, navigate to **Administrator**.
2. Select **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub**.
3. Search for the Alauda Service Mesh v2.
4. Locate the Alauda Service Mesh v2, and click to select it.
5. Click **All Instances** tab.
6. Click the `Istio` instance, named `default`.
7. Click **YAML** to view the `Istio` configuration.
8. Click **Actions** > **Update** to make modifications to the `Istio` configuration.

For a complete list of available configuration for the values field, refer to [sail-operator's documentation](https://github.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/blob/main/docs/api-reference/sailoperator.io.md).
