# Istioctl tool

Alauda Service Mesh 2 supports `istioctl`, the official command line utility for the Istio project that includes many diagnostic and debugging utilities.

## Installing the Istioctl tool

Install the `istioctl` command-line utility to debug and diagnose Istio service mesh deployments.

**Prerequisites**

- The Alauda Service Mesh 2 Operator is installed and running.
- You have created at least one `Istio` resource.

**Procedure**

1. Confirm which version of the `Istio` resource runs on the installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get istio -ojsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.spec.version}{'\n'}{end}" | sed s/^v// | sort
   ```

   If there are multiple Istio resources with different versions, choose the latest version. The latest version is displayed last.

2. Navigate to [https://github.com/istio/istio/releases](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases).

3. Locate the appropriate version and os arch from GitHub releases page.

4. Extract the `istioctl` binary file.

   1. If you are using a Linux operating system, run the following command:

      ```bash
      tar xzf istioctl-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz
      ```

   2. If you are using an Apple Mac operating system, unpack and extract the archive.

   3. If you are using a Microsoft Windows operating system, use the zip software to extract the archive.

5. Move to the uncompressed directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd istioctl-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>
   ```

6. Add the `istioctl` client to the path by running the following command:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
   ```

7. Confirm that the `istioctl` client version and the Istio control plane version match or are within one version by running the following command:

   ```bash
   istioctl version
   ```

   **Example output**

   ```
   client version: 1.20.0
   control plane version: 1.24.6-asm.r0
   data plane version: none
   ```
