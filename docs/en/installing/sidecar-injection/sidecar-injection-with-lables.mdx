# Enabling Sidecar Injection

The following procedures utilize the Bookinfo application to illustrate various methods for configuring sidecar injection.

## Prerequisites

- The Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator is installed, an `Istio` resource has been created, and the Operator has successfully deployed Istio.
- The `IstioCNI` resource has been created, and the Operator has deployed the required `IstioCNI` pods.
- The namespaces intended for the mesh have been created and are discoverable by the Istio control plane.
- Optional: The workloads to be included in the mesh are already deployed. For the subsequent examples, the Bookinfo application is deployed in the `bookinfo` namespace, but sidecar injection (as described in step 2) is not yet configured. See "[Deploying the Bookinfo application](../installing-service-mesh/application-deployment/deploying-the-bookinfo-application.mdx)" for more details.

## Enabling Sidecar Injection Using Namespace Labels

This method injects a sidecar proxy into all workloads within a given namespace. It is the ideal approach when most workloads in that namespace need to be part of the mesh.

### Procedure

1.  Check the revision name of the Istio control plane with the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get istiorevisions
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME      NAMESPACE      PROFILE   READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
    default   istio-system             True    Healthy   False    v1.26.3   2m
    ```

    Because the revision name is `default`, you can use the standard injection labels without specifying the exact revision.

2.  Confirm that existing workloads in the target namespace show `1/1` ready containers by running the command below. This verifies the pods are currently running without sidecars.

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-c66556f6d-6zldd        1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    productpage-v1-5f568ff46d-kx7nn   1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    ratings-v1-74bcfcb96d-jp4xk       1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    reviews-v1-549bfb5f44-sv2n9       1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    reviews-v2-6486bc9868-56h7n       1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    reviews-v3-6c66dc6cdd-vmczd       1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    ```

3.  Apply the injection label to the `bookinfo` namespace by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
    ```

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    namespace/bookinfo labeled
    ```

4.  To apply the sidecar injection, redeploy the workloads in the `bookinfo` namespace. Initiate a rolling update for all deployments with this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo rollout restart deployments
    ```

### Verification

1.  To verify the rollout, check that the new pods show `2/2` containers in the `READY` state, which confirms a successful sidecar injection. Use the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-85c7fcfd5b-hftlt       2/2     Running   0          31s
    productpage-v1-775ffc67d8-482s6   2/2     Running   0          31s
    ratings-v1-6c79fdf684-d7jmn       2/2     Running   0          31s
    reviews-v1-685fb87cb6-rch6v       2/2     Running   0          31s
    reviews-v2-76c4659bc6-vjcd8       2/2     Running   0          31s
    reviews-v3-f7b4c8678-zdnm7        2/2     Running   0          31s
    ```

## Excluding a Workload from the Mesh

It is possible to prevent sidecar injection for a specific workload even when injection is enabled for its entire namespace.

:::note
This example serves only as a demonstration. For the Bookinfo application to function correctly, all of its workloads must be part of the mesh.
:::

### Procedure

1.  Edit the `Deployment` resource for the application. In this example, we will exclude the `ratings-v1` service.

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo edit deployments ratings-v1
    ```

2.  In the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of the `Deployment`, add the label `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"` to disable sidecar injection.

    ```yaml
    kind: Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    metadata:
    name: ratings-v1
    namespace: bookinfo
    labels:
      app: ratings
      version: v1
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
    ```

    :::note
    The sidecar injection process is not affected if this label is added to the top-level `labels` section of the `Deployment`.
    :::

    When the deployment is updated, a rollout is triggered, which creates a new ReplicaSet containing the modified pod(s).

### Verification

1.  Confirm that the updated pod(s) lack a sidecar container and display `1/1` running containers by executing this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-85c7fcfd5b-hftlt       2/2     Running   0          4m7s
    productpage-v1-775ffc67d8-482s6   2/2     Running   0          4m7s
    ratings-v1-7988b9b7f4-7hdwm       1/1     Running   0          16s
    reviews-v1-685fb87cb6-rch6v       2/2     Running   0          4m7s
    reviews-v2-76c4659bc6-vjcd8       2/2     Running   0          4m7s
    reviews-v3-f7b4c8678-zdnm7        2/2     Running   0          4m7s
    ```

## Enabling Sidecar Injection Using Pod Labels

With this method, you can select individual workloads for sidecar injection rather than enabling it for an entire namespace. This is best suited for cases where only a small number of workloads require inclusion in the service mesh. The example also shows how to use a revision label for sidecar injection, where the `Istio` resource is named `my-mesh`. Using a distinct `Istio` resource name is necessary when multiple Istio control planes exist in one cluster or during a control plane upgrade that is based on revisions.

### Procedure

1.  Check the Istio control plane's revision name by running this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get istiorevisions
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME      NAMESPACE      PROFILE   READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
    my-mesh   istio-system             True    Healthy   False    v1.26.3   22s
    ```

    Because the revision name is `my-mesh`, the revision label `istio.io/rev=my-mesh` must be used to activate sidecar injection.

2.  Confirm that existing pods are running without sidecars by checking that they show `1/1` containers in the `READY` state. Use this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-85c7fcfd5b-8kzrc       1/1     Running   0          74s
    productpage-v1-775ffc67d8-rtbxj   1/1     Running   0          74s
    ratings-v1-6c79fdf684-ntzdr       1/1     Running   0          74s
    reviews-v1-685fb87cb6-l9fvr       1/1     Running   0          74s
    reviews-v2-76c4659bc6-7gt2l       1/1     Running   0          74s
    reviews-v3-f7b4c8678-lw59c        1/1     Running   0          74s
    ```

3.  Edit the `Deployment` resource of the application. For this example, modify the `ratings-v1` service.

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bookinfo edit deployments ratings-v1
    ```

4.  Modify the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of the `Deployment` to add the required pod injection or revision label. Here, it is `istio.io/rev: my-mesh`:

    ```yaml
    kind: Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    metadata:
    name: ratings-v1
    namespace: bookinfo
    labels:
      app: ratings
      version: v1
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            istio.io/rev: my-mesh
    ```

    :::note
    Placing the label in the top-level `labels` section of the `Deployment` resource will not affect sidecar injection.
    :::

    This update to the deployment initiates a rollout, which results in a new ReplicaSet with the changed pod(s).

### Verification

1.  Confirm that the sidecar was injected successfully by verifying that only the `ratings-v1` pod displays `2/2` ready containers. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n bookinfo
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-85c7fcfd5b-8kzrc       1/1     Running   0          2m29s
    productpage-v1-775ffc67d8-rtbxj   1/1     Running   0          2m29s
    ratings-v1-86d864565d-g8sqw       2/2     Running   0          17s
    reviews-v1-685fb87cb6-l9fvr       1/1     Running   0          2m29s
    reviews-v2-76c4659bc6-7gt2l       1/1     Running   0          2m29s
    reviews-v3-f7b4c8678-lw59c        1/1     Running   0          2m29s
    ```

2.  Follow the same process for any other workloads you want to add to the mesh.
