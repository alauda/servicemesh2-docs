# Installing a primary-remote multi-network mesh

Install Istio in a primary-remote multi-network topology on two clusters.

:::note
In this procedure, `CLUSTER1` is the **East** cluster and `CLUSTER2` is the **West** cluster. The **East** cluster is the primary cluster and the **West** cluster is the remote cluster.
:::

You can adapt these instructions for a mesh spanning more than two clusters.

**Topology**

Service workloads across cluster boundaries communicate indirectly, via dedicated gateways for east-west traffic.
The gateway in each cluster must be reachable from the other cluster.

Services in `cluster2` will reach the control plane in `cluster1` via the same east-west gateway.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the Alauda Service Mesh 2 Operator on all of the clusters that comprise the mesh.
- You have completed [Creating certificates for a multi-cluster mesh](./configuration-overview.mdx#creating-certificates-for-a-multi-cluster-mesh).
- You have completed [Applying certificates to a multi-cluster topology](./configuration-overview.mdx#applying-certificates-to-a-multi-network-multi-cluster-mesh).
- You have `istioctl` installed locally so that you can use to run these instructions.

## Procedure

<Steps>
  ### Create an `ISTIO_VERSION` environment variable that defines the Istio version to install

  ```bash
  export ISTIO_VERSION=1.24.6
  ```

  ### Install Istio on the **East** cluster

  1. Set the default network for the **East** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" label namespace istio-system topology.istio.io/network=network1
     ```

  2. Create an `Istio` resource on the **East** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     cat <<EOF | kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER1}" apply -f -
     apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
     kind: Istio
     metadata:
       name: default
     spec:
       version: v${ISTIO_VERSION}
       namespace: istio-system
       values:
         global:
           meshID: mesh1
           multiCluster:
             clusterName: cluster1
           network: network1
           externalIstiod: true  # [!code callout]
     EOF
     ```

     <Callouts>
       1. This enables the control plane installed on the **East** cluster to serve as an external control plane for other remote clusters.
     </Callouts>

  3. Wait for the control plane to return the "Ready" status condition by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER1}" wait --for condition=Ready istio/default --timeout=3m
     ```

  4. Create an East-West gateway on the **East** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER1}" apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aladua-mesh/sail-operator/main/docs/deployment-models/resources/east-west-gateway-net1.yaml
     ```

  5. Expose the control plane through the gateway so that services in the **West** cluster can access the control plane by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER1}" apply -n istio-system -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/main/docs/deployment-models/resources/expose-istiod.yaml
     ```

  6. Expose the application services through the gateway by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER1}" apply -n istio-system -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/main/docs/deployment-models/resources/expose-services.yaml
     ```

  ### Install Istio on the **West** cluster

  1. Save the IP address of the East-West gateway running in the **East** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     export DISCOVERY_ADDRESS=$(kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" \
        -n istio-system get svc istio-eastwestgateway \
        -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
     ```

  2. Create an `Istio` resource on the West cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     cat <<EOF | kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER2}" apply -f -
     apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
     kind: Istio
     metadata:
       name: default
     spec:
       version: v${ISTIO_VERSION}
       namespace: istio-system
       profile: remote
       values:
         istiodRemote:
           injectionPath: /inject/cluster/cluster2/net/network2
         global:
           remotePilotAddress: ${DISCOVERY_ADDRESS}
     EOF
     ```

  3. Annotate the `istio-system` namespace in the **West** cluster so that it is managed by the control plane in the **East** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER2}" annotate namespace istio-system topology.istio.io/controlPlaneClusters=cluster1
     ```

  4. Set the default network for the **West** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER2}" label namespace istio-system topology.istio.io/network=network2
     ```

  5. Install a remote secret on the **East** cluster that provides access to the API server on the **West** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     istioctl create-remote-secret \
       --context="${CTX_CLUSTER2}" \
       --name=cluster2 | \
       kubectl --context="${CTX_CLUSTER1}" apply -f -
     ```

  6. Wait for the `Istio` resource to return the "Ready" status condition by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER2}" wait --for condition=Ready istio/default --timeout=3m
     ```

  7. Create an East-West gateway on the **West** cluster by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl --context "${CTX_CLUSTER2}" apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aladua-mesh/sail-operator/main/docs/deployment-models/resources/east-west-gateway-net2.yaml
     ```

     :::note
     Since the **West** cluster is installed with a remote profile, exposing the application services on the **East** cluster exposes them on the East-West gateways of both clusters.
