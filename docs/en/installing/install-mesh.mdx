# Installing Alauda Service Mesh

Installing Alauda Service Mesh consists four major parts:

- Installing the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator
- Deploying Istio CNI
- Deploying Istio control plane
- Customizing the Istio configuration

:::warning
Before installing Alauda Service Mesh v2, make sure you are not running Alauda Service Mesh and Alauda Service Mesh v2 in the same cluster,
because it will lead to conflicts currently.

Migration guide will be provided in an upcoming release.
:::

## About deploying Istio using the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator

To deploy Istio using Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator, `Istio` resource is required to be created.
The Operator then creates an `IstioRevision` resources, representing a distinct revision of the Istio control plane.
The Istio control plane is subsequently deployed based on these `IstioRevision` resources.

The Operator might create additional `IstioRevision` instances, when the `Istio` resource's update strategy is set to `RevisionBased`.

## Installing the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator

**Prerequisites**

- The Alauda Service Mesh v2 must be uploaded.
- You are logged in to the Alauda Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.
- The Alauda Container Platform Networking for Multus plugin must be installed.

**Procedure**

1. In the Alauda Container Platform web console, navigate to **Administrator**.
2. Select **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub**.
3. Search for the Alauda Service Mesh v2.
4. Locate the Alauda Service Mesh v2, and click to select it.
5. Click **Install**.
6. On the **Install Alauda Service Mesh v2** dialogue, perform the following steps:
   1. Select an **Channel**
      - Choose the **latest** channel to install the latest stable version of the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator. It is the default channel for installing the Operator.
      - To install a specific version of the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator, choose the corresponding `servicemesh-<version>` channel. For example, to install the Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator version 2.0.x, use the **servicemesh-2.0** channel.
7. Click **Install** and **Confirm** to install the Operator.

**Verification**

Confirm that the **Installation Info** tile shows `Succeeded`.

### About Service Mesh custom resource definitions

Installing Alauda Service Mesh v2 also provisions two categories of custom resource definitions (CRDs) that administrators can use to configure Istio for the service mesh:

- **Sail Operator CRDs** defines custom resources for installing and maintaining the Istio components.
  They belong to the `sailoperator.io` API group and include `Istio`, `IstioRevision`, `IstioCNI`, and `ZTunnel` resource kinds.
  For configuration details, refer to the `sailoperator.io` [API reference](https://github.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/blob/main/docs/api-reference/sailoperator.io.md) documentation.

- **Istio CRDs** are associated with mesh configuration, service and traffic management.
  Those CRDs define custom resources in several `istio.io` API groups, such as `networking.istio.io`, `security.istio.io`, and `telemetry.istio.io`, see the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/) for more information.

## About Istio deployment

To deploy Istio, you must create `Istio` and `IstioCNI` resources.

The `Istio` resource is responsible for deploying and configuring the Istio Control Plane.

The `IstioCNI` resource handles the deployment and configuration of the Istio Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin.

It's required to create these `Istio` and `IstioCNI` resources in separate namespaces.

### Creating the namespace for Istio

```bash
kubectl create namespace istio-system
kubectl label namespace istio-system cpaas.io/project=cpaas-system
```

### Creating the Istio resource using web console

Create the `Istio` resource that will contain the YAML configuration for your Istio deployment.
The Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator leverages this resource's configuration to deploy the Istio Control Plane.

**Prerequisites**

- The Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator must be installed.
- You are logged in to the Alauda Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.
- The Alauda Container Platform Networking for Multus plugin must be installed.
-

**Procedure**

1. In the Alauda Container Platform web console, navigate to **Administrator**.
2. Select **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub**.
3. Search for the Alauda Service Mesh v2.
4. Locate the Alauda Service Mesh v2, and click to select it.
5. Click **All Instances** tab.
6. Click **Create**.
7. Locate and Select **Istio** and then click **Create**.
8. Select the `istio-system` from the **Namespace** drop down.
9. Click **Create**.

**Verification**

Wait for `.status.state` field of the `Istio` resource to be `Healthy`.

### Creating the namespace for IstioCNI

```bash
kubectl create namespace istio-cni
```

### Creating the IstioCNI resource using web console

Create an Istio Container Network Interface (CNI) resource, which contains the configuration file for the Istio CNI plugin.
The Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator uses this resource's configuration to deploy the CNI pod.

**Prerequisites**

- You are logged in to the Alauda Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.
- The Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator must be installed.
- The Alauda Container Platform Networking for Multus plugin must be installed.

**Procedure**

1. In the Alauda Container Platform web console, navigate to **Administrator**.
2. Select **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub**.
3. Search for the Alauda Service Mesh v2.
4. Locate the Alauda Service Mesh v2, and click to select it.
5. Click **All Instances** tab.
6. Click **Create**.
7. Locate and Select **IstioCNI** and then click **Create**.
8. Select the `istio-cni` from the **Namespace** drop down.
9. Click **YAML** tab.
10. Add the following YAML snippet to the **YAML** code editor:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
    kind: IstioCNI
    spec:
      # Applying the following contents to the yaml code editor:
      values:
        provider: multus  # [!code callout]
    ```
    <Callouts>
      1. Indicates that we should use Multus as the CNI provider.
    </Callouts>
11. Click **Create**.

**Verification**

Wait for `.status.state` field of the `IstioCNI` resource to be `Healthy`.

## Customizing Istio configuration

The `values` field of the `Istio` custom resource definition, which was created when the control plane was deployed,
can be used to customize Istio configuration using Istio's `Helm` configuration values.

**Procedure**

1. In the Alauda Container Platform web console, navigate to **Administrator**.
2. Select **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub**.
3. Search for the Alauda Service Mesh v2.
4. Locate the Alauda Service Mesh v2, and click to select it.
5. Click **All Instances** tab.
6. Click the `Istio` instance, named `default`.
7. Click **YAML** to view the `Istio` configuration.
8. Click **Actions** > **Update** to make modifications to the `Istio` configuration.

For a complete list of available configuration for the values field, refer to [sail-operator's documentation](https://github.com/alauda-mesh/sail-operator/blob/main/docs/api-reference/sailoperator.io.md).
