# Sidecar injection

In order to take advantage of all of Istio’s features, pods in the service mesh must be running an Istio sidecar proxy.

## About sidecar injection

Sidecar proxy injection is primarily controlled through labels applied at either the namespace or pod level.

When enabled in namespace, automatic injection injects the proxy configuration at pod creation time using an admission controller,
ensures any new pods in that namespace include a sidecar.

The revision label is also used to dictates which Istio control plane instance the sidecar will associate with.

Note that unlike manual injection, automatic injection occurs at the pod-level. You won’t see any change to the deployment itself.
Instead, you’ll want to check individual pods (via `kubectl describe`) to see the injected proxy.

## Identifying the revision name

The label required to enable sidecar injection is determined by the specific control plane instance, known as a revision.
Each revision is managed by corresponding `IstioRevision` resource, which is automatically managed by the `Istio` resource.

The naming convention for an `IstioRevision` is based on the `spec.updateStrategy.type` setting in the `Istio` resource:

- `InPlace`: The revision shares the same name as the parent `Istio` resource.
- `RevisionBased`: The revision is named using the format `<istio-resource-name>-v<version>`.

Typically, each `Istio` resource corresponds to a single `IstioRevision`.
However, during a revision-based upgrade, multiple `IstioRevision` resources may exist, each representing a distinct control plane.

To list available revisions, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get istiorevisions
```

For example output:

```
NAME              NAMESPACE      PROFILE   READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
default-v1-24-6   istio-system             True    Healthy   False    v1.24.6   40s
```

### Enabling sidecar injection with default revision

When the name of `IstioRevision` is `default`, you can use the following labels on a namespace or a pod to enable sidecar injection:

| **Resource** | **Enabled label**              | **Disalbed label**              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Namespace    | `istio-injection=enabled`      | `istio-injection=disabled`      |
| Pod          | `sidecar.istio.io/inject=true` | `sidecar.istio.io/inject=false` |

:::note
You can also enable injection by applying the `istio.io/rev: default` label to the namespace or pod.
:::

### Enabling sidecar injection with other revisions

When then name of `IstioRevision` is not `default`, you'll need to use the specific `IstioRevision` name with the `istio.io/rev` label.
This links the pod to the desired control plane and enables sidecar injection.

For instance, using the example revision `default-v1-24-5` from above, the following labels would enable sidecar injection:

| **Resource** | **Enabled label**              | **Disabled label**              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Namespace    | `istio.io/rev=default-v1-24-5` | `istio-injection=disabled`      |
| Pod          | `istio.io/rev=default-v1-24-5` | `sidecar.istio.io/inject=false` |

:::note
When both `istio-injection` and `istio.io/rev` labels are applied, the `istio-injection` label takes precedence and treats the namespace as part of the default revision.
:::

The injector is configured with the following logic:

1. If either label (`istio-injection` or `sidecar.istio.io/inject`) is disabled, the pod is not injected.
2. If either label (`istio-injection` or `sidecar.istio.io/inject` or `istio.io/rev`) is enabled, the pod is injected.
