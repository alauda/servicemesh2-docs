# About Alauda Service Mesh

Alauda Service Mesh is built on the open source [Istio](https://istio.io) project and provides a centralized control plane for managing microservices-based architectures. It enables consistent traffic management, security, policy enforcement, and observability across distributed applications.

## Introduction to Alauda Service Mesh

Alauda Service Mesh introduces a transparent, infrastructure-level abstraction that integrates with existing applications without requiring modifications to application code. It facilitates communication between services and enhances the reliability, security, and observability of service interactions.

The service mesh supports core networking capabilities such as service discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics collection, and monitoring. It also enables advanced deployment strategies and operational features, including A/B testing, canary deployments, fine-grained access control, and end-to-end authentication.

In microservices architectures, applications are decomposed into independently deployable services. While this approach improves scalability and maintainability, it can introduce challenges related to service communication, observability, and control. Alauda Service Mesh addresses these challenges by intercepting traffic between services and enabling centralized management of communication policies and telemetry.

## Core features

Alauda Service Mesh provides the following core capabilities across the service network:

- **Traffic Management**
  Enables control over the flow of traffic and API calls between services. This includes routing, retries, failovers, and fault injection, which help improve service reliability and network resilience.

- **Service Identity and Security**
  Assigns cryptographic identities to services and secures service-to-service communication through mutual TLS (mTLS). This ensures traffic integrity and confidentiality in environments with varying levels of trust.

- **Policy Enforcement**
  Applies organizational policies to service communication. This includes access control, rate limiting, and quota enforcement. Policy configuration is decoupled from application logic and is managed through the mesh control plane.

- **Telemetry and Observability**
  Collects detailed metrics, logs, and tracing data to provide visibility into service behavior, dependencies, and traffic patterns. This enables faster troubleshooting and improved performance monitoring.
