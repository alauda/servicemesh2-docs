# Alauda Service Mesh v2.1

Alauda Service Mesh v2.1 is built on the [Istio](https://istio.io/) project and is installed using a new Istio Operator derived from the [Sail Operator](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/sail-operator) (hosted in the **istio-ecosystem** GitHub organization). The Operator provides an expanded set of custom resource definitions (CRDs) to manage Istio components.
