# Alauda Service Mesh v2.0

Alauda Service Mesh v2.0 is built on the [Istio](https://istio.io/) project and is installed using a new Istio Operator derived from the [Sail Operator](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/sail-operator) (hosted in the **istio-ecosystem** GitHub organization). The Operator provides an expanded set of custom resource definitions (CRDs) to manage Istio components.

## Supported component versions

- `Istio` version: v1.24.6 and v1.26.3
    - Istio 1.26 [supports Kubernetes](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases) 1.29, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33
    - Istio 1.24 [supports Kubernetes](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases) 1.28, 1.29, 1.30, 1.31
- `Kiali operator` version: v2.11.0

## Features

- Provides support for `istioctl`, the Istio command-line tool that offers diagnostic and debugging utilities.
- Support multi-cluster deployment models:
    - Multi-primary
    - Primary-remote
- Enables canary-style upgrades of the Istio control plane via the Istio revision mechanism.
- Support for the `IstioRevisionTag` resource — a stable revision tag that acts as an alias for Istio control plane revisions.
- Includes management for the Istio Container Network Interface through the `IstioCNI` CRD, which handles the CNI daemonset lifecycle.
- Metrics and tracing integrations
    - **Monitoring components**: Leverages Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics for metrics collection and Alertmanager for alerting.
    - **Distributed Tracing Platform**: Provides end-to-end distributed tracing capabilities using components such as Jaeger and OpenTelemetry.
    - **Alauda Build of Kiali**: Offers visualization and operational insights into the service mesh, including real-time traffic topology, configuration validation, and tracing integration.
