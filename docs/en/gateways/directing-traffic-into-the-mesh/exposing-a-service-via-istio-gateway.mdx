# Exposing a service via Istio Gateway and VirtualService resources

This guide demonstrates using Istio `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources to configure a gateway deployed via gateway injection. These resources set up the gateway to expose a service inside the mesh to traffic from outside. Afterward, you expose the gateway to traffic external to the cluster by changing the gateway's `Service` to type `LoadBalancer`.

## Prerequisites

  - An Istio gateway has been installed using [gateway injection](../gateway-installation/installing-a-gateway-via-injection.mdx).

## Procedure

1.  Create a new namespace named `httpbin` by executing the command below:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace httpbin
    ```

2.  Enable sidecar injection for the namespace. If your setup uses the `InPlace` upgrade strategy, run this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl label namespace httpbin istio-injection=enabled
    ```

    <Directive type="note">

    If you are using the `RevisionBased` upgrade strategy, execute these commands:

    1.  To discover your `<revision-name>`, run the following:

        ```shell
        kubectl get istiorevisions.sailoperator.io
        ```

        **Sample output:**

        ```shell
        NAME      NAMESPACE      PROFILE   READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
        default   istio-system             True    Healthy   True     v1.26.3   47h
        ```

    2.  Label the namespace using the revision name to enable sidecar injection:

        ```shell
        kubectl label namespace httpbin istio.io/rev=default
        ```
    
    </Directive>

3.  Deploy the `httpbin` sample service by running the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n httpbin -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
    ```

4.  Create a file named `httpbin-gw.yaml` that contains an Istio `Gateway` resource definition. This resource configures the gateway proxies to open port 80 (HTTP) for the host `httpbin.example.com`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: httpbin-gateway
      namespace: httpbin
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: <gateway_name>  # [!code callout]
      servers:
        - port:
            number: 80
            name: http
            protocol: HTTP
          hosts:
            - httpbin.example.com  # [!code callout]
    ```

    <Callouts>
        1. Set the `selector` to match the unique label or labels defined in the pod template of the gateway proxy `Deployment`. By default, the Istio `Gateway` configuration applies to matching gateway pods across all namespaces.
        2. In the `hosts` field, list the addresses that clients can use to access a mesh service on the corresponding port.
    </Callouts>

5.  Apply the YAML file with this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f httpbin-gw.yaml
    ```

6.  Create another YAML file named `httpbin-vs.yaml` for a `VirtualService`. This `VirtualService` will define rules to route traffic from the gateway proxy to the `httpbin` service.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
      namespace: httpbin
    spec:
      hosts:
        - httpbin.example.com  # [!code callout]
      gateways:
        - httpbin-gateway  # [!code callout]
      http:
        - match:
            - uri:
                prefix: /status
            - uri:
                prefix: /headers
          route:
            - destination:  # [!code callout]
                port:
                  number: 8000
                host: httpbin
    ```
    <Callouts>
        1.  Define the `hosts` to which the `VirtualService` routing rules will apply. The specified `hosts` must be exposed by the Istio `Gateway` resource to which this `VirtualService` is attached.
        2.  Attach the `VirtualService` to the Istio `Gateway` resource from the previous step by adding the `Gateway`'s name to the gateways list.
        3.  Direct matching traffic to the previously deployed `httpbin` service by defining a `destination` that specifies the `host` and `port` of the `httpbin` `Service`.
    </Callouts>

7.  Apply the YAML file using this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f httpbin-vs.yaml
    ```


## Verification

1.  Create a namespace for a `curl` client by executing this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace curl
    ```

2.  Deploy the `curl` client with the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/curl/curl.yaml
    ```

3. Store the name of the `curl` pod in a `CURL_POD` variable by running this command:

    ```shell
    CURL_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n curl -l app=curl -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    ```

4. From the `curl` client, send a request to the `/headers` endpoint of the `httpbin` application via the ingress gateway `Service`. Set the `Host` header to `httpbin.example.com` to align with the host specified in the Istio `Gateway` and `VirtualService`. Execute the following `curl` command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec $CURL_POD -n curl -- \
      curl -s -I \
        -H Host:httpbin.example.com \
        <gateway_name>.<gateway_namespace>.svc.cluster.local/headers
    ```

5. The response should show a `200 OK` HTTP status, confirming the request was successful.

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: istio-envoy
    ...
    ```

6. Send another request to an endpoint that lacks a corresponding URI prefix match in the `httpbin` `VirtualService` by running this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec $CURL_POD -n curl -- \
      curl -s -I \
        -H Host:httpbin.example.com \
        <gateway_name>.<gateway_namespace>.svc.cluster.local/get
    ```

    The response should be a `404 Not Found` status. This is the expected outcome because the `/get` endpoint does not have a defined URI prefix match in the `httpbin` `VirtualService`.

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    server: istio-envoy
    ...
    ```

7. Expose the gateway proxy to traffic from outside the cluster by changing its `Service` type to `LoadBalancer`:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch service <gateway_name> -n <gateway_namespace> -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
    ```

8. Confirm that the `httpbin` service is accessible from outside the cluster using the gateway `Service`'s external hostname or IP address. Make sure to set the `INGRESS_HOST` variable correctly for your cluster's environment.

    1.  Set the `INGRESS_HOST` variable with this command:

        ```shell
        INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get service <gateway_name> -n <gateway_namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
        ```

        <Directive type="danger" title=" ">

        In certain environments, the load balancer may be exposed using a host name, instead of an IP address. In this case, the ingress gateway's `EXTERNAL-IP` value will not be an IP address, but rather a host name, and the above command will have failed to set the `INGRESS_HOST` environment variable. Use the following command to correct the `INGRESS_HOST` value:

        ```shell
        INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get service <gateway_name> -n <gateway_namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
        ```

        </Directive>

    2.  Send a `curl` request to the `httpbin` service using the gateway's host by running this command:

        ```shell
        curl -s -I -H Host:httpbin.example.com http://$INGRESS_HOST/headers
        ```

9. Check that the response includes the `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` status, which confirms the request succeeded.
