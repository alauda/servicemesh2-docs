# Exposing a service via Kubernetes Gateway API

You can use the Kubernetes Gateway API to create `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` resources to deploy a gateway. These resources configure the gateway to make a service inside the mesh accessible to traffic from outside. You can then change the gateway's `Service` to `LoadBalancer` to expose it to traffic external to the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Alauda Service Mesh v2 Operator is installed.
- An Istio control plane is deployed.

## Procedure

1.  Create a new namespace named `httpbin` with the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace httpbin
    ```

2.  Deploy the `httpbin` sample service with this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n httpbin -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
    ```

3.  Create a file named `httpbin-k8s-gw.yaml` that defines a Kubernetes `Gateway` resource. This will configure gateway proxies to expose port 80 (HTTP) for the `httpbin.example.com` host.
    
    <Directive type="info" title="Automated deployment">
    By default, each `Gateway` will automatically provision a `Service` and `Deployment`. These will be named `<Gateway name>-<GatewayClass name>` (with the exception of the `istio-waypoint` `GatewayClass`, which does not append a suffix). These configurations will be updated automatically if the `Gateway` changes (for example, if a new port is added).
    </Directive>

    **Example gateway resource file**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      annotations:
        networking.istio.io/service-type: ClusterIP  # [!code callout]
      name: httpbin-gateway  # [!code callout]
      namespace: httpbin  # [!code callout]
    spec:
      gatewayClassName: istio
      listeners:
        - name: http
          hostname: "httpbin.example.com"  # [!code callout]
          port: 80
          protocol: HTTP
          allowedRoutes:
            namespaces:
              from: All
    ```

    <Callouts>
        1.  Specifies the gateway's `Service` type; defaults to `LoadBalancer`.
        2.  Specifies the gateway's name.
        3.  Specifies the gateway's namespace.
        4.  Specifies the virtual hostname for clients to use when accessing a mesh service on this port.
    </Callouts>

4.  Apply the YAML file with this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f httpbin-k8s-gw.yaml
    ```

5.  Create a YAML file named `httpbin-hr.yaml` that defines an `HTTPRoute` resource. This resource specifies the rules for routing traffic from the gateway proxy to the `httpbin` service.

    **Example HTTPRoute file**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
      namespace: httpbin
    spec:
      parentRefs:  # [!code callout]
      - name: httpbin-gateway
        namespace: httpbin
      rules:
      - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /status
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /headers
        backendRefs:  # [!code callout]
        - name: httpbin
          port: 8000
    ```

    <Callouts>
        1.  Links the `HTTPROUTE` resource to the Kubernetes `Gateway` created previously by adding the gateway's name to the list of gateways.
        2.  Directs matching traffic to the `httpbin` service by defining a `backendRefs` entry that includes the name and port of the `httpbin` `Service`.
    </Callouts>

6.  Apply the YAML file by executing this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f httpbin-hr.yaml
    ```

7.  Confirm that the Gateway API service is ready and has an allocated address by running this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl wait --for=condition=programmed gtw httpbin-gateway -n httpbin
    ```

## Verification

1.  Create a namespace for a `curl` client by executing this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace curl
    ```

2.  Deploy a `curl` client using the command below:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/refs/heads/master/samples/curl/curl.yaml
    ```

3.  Set a `CURL_POD` variable with the name of the `curl` pod with this command:

    ```shell
    CURL_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n curl -l app=curl -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    ```

4.  From the `curl` client, send a request to the `/headers` endpoint of the `httpbin` application via the ingress gateway `Service`. Set the `Host` header to `httpbin.example.com` to match the host specified in the Kubernetes `Gateway` and `HTTPROUTE` resources. Run the following `curl` command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec $CURL_POD -n curl -- \
      curl -s -I \
        -H Host:httpbin.example.com \
        httpbin-gateway-istio.httpbin.svc.cluster.local/headers
    ```

    The response should show a `200 OK` HTTP status, indicating a successful request.

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    server: istio-envoy
    ...
    ```

5.  Send a `curl` request to an endpoint without a matching Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) prefix in the `httpbin` `HTTPROUTE` by running this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec $CURL_POD -n curl -- \
      curl -s -I \
        -H Host:httpbin.example.com \
        httpbin-gateway-istio.httpbin.svc.cluster.local/get
    ```

    The response will be a `404 Not Found` status. This is expected, as the `/get` endpoint does not have a matching URI prefix defined in the `httpbin` `HTTPROUTE` resource.

    **Example output**

    ```shell
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    server: istio-envoy
    ...
    ```

6.  Expose the gateway proxy to external traffic by setting its `Service` type to the default `LoadBalancer`. Run this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n httpbin annotate gtw httpbin-gateway networking.istio.io/service-type-
    ```

7.  Verify that the `httpbin` service is accessible from outside the cluster by using the external hostname or IP address of the gateway `Service`. Ensure the `INGRESS_HOST` variable is set appropriately for your cluster's environment.

    a.  Set the `INGRESS_HOST` variable by running this command:

        ```shell
        export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get gtw httpbin-gateway -n httpbin -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
        ```

    b.  Set the `INGRESS_PORT` variable by running this command:

        ```shell
        INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl get gtw httpbin-gateway -n httpbin -o jsonpath='{.spec.listeners[?(@.name=="http")].port}')
        ```

    c.  Using the gateway host, send a `curl` request to the `httpbin` service with this command:

        ```shell
        curl -s -I -H Host:httpbin.example.com http://$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT/headers
        ```

8.  Verify that the response shows the `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` status, which confirms the request was successful.
