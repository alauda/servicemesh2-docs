# Distributed Tracing and Service Mesh

## Configuring distributed tracing platform with Service Mesh

Alauda Service Mesh supports distributed tracing through integration with the following components:

- **Alauda Build of Jaeger**: A customized distribution based on the open source [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) project. It provides end-to-end visibility into requests across complex distributed systems.

- **Alauda Build of OpenTelemetry**: Based on the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project, this component simplifies telemetry data collection across metrics, logs, and traces by managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and workload instrumentation.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) acts as an intermediary for telemetry signals. It supports multiple data formats and provides a standardized pipeline for processing and exporting telemetry to backends such as Jaeger.

## Configuring distributed tracing data collection with Service Mesh

You can integrate Alauda Service Mesh with OpenTelemetry to instrument, generate, collect, and export OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and logs to analyze and understand your software's performance and behavior.

**Prerequisites**

- Alauda Build of Jaeger is installed.
- Alauda Build of OpenTelemetry is installed.
- A `Jaeger` instance is installed and configured in the `cpaas-system` namespace.
- An Istio instance is created.
- An Istio CNI instance is created.

**Procedure**

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to Alauda Build of OpenTelemetry in OperatorHub and creates `OpenTelemetryCollector` in the `istio-system` namespace.

  **Example OpenTelemetry Collector in `istio-system` namespace**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1
  kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
  metadata:
    name: otel
    namespace: istio-system
  spec:
    observability:
      metrics: {}
    deploymentUpdateStrategy: {}
    config:
      processors:
        batch: {}
      exporters:
        debug: {}
        otlp:
          endpoint: 'dns:///jaeger-prod-collector-headless.cpaas-system:4317'  # [!code callout]
          balancer_name: round_robin
          tls:
            insecure: true
      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
              endpoint: '0.0.0.0:4317'
      service:
        pipelines:
          traces:
            exporters:
              - debug
              - oltp
            processors:
              - batch
            receivers:
              - otlp
  ```

  <Callouts>
    1. The `endpoint` field is the `Jaeger` collector service in the `cpaas-system` namespace.
  </Callouts>

  ### Update the `Istio` resource to enable tracing and define the OpenTelemetry tracing provider:

  **Example: Enabling tracing via `meshConfig`**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
  kind: Istio
  metadata:
    name: default
    # ...
  spec:
    namespace: istio-system
    # ...
    values:
      meshConfig:
        enableTracing: true
        extensionProviders:
        - name: otel
          opentelemetry:
            port: 4317
            service: otel-collector.istio-system.svc.cluster.local  # [!code callout]
  ```

  <Callouts>
    1. The `service` field is the `OpenTelemetry` collector service in the `istio-system` namespace.
  </Callouts>

  ### Update the `Telemetry` resource to enable the tracing provider defined in the `meshConfig`:

  **Example Istio Telemetry resource**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1
  kind: Telemetry
  metadata:
    name: asm-default
    namespace: istio-system
    # ...
  spec:
    # ...
    tracing:
      - providers:
          - name: otel
        randomSamplingPercentage: 100
  ```

  :::note
  Once you verify that you can see traces, lower the `randomSamplingPercentage` value or set it to `default` to reduce the number of requests.
