# Observability and Service Mesh

Observability enables real-time insight into the behavior and performance of distributed applications by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. This functionality assists in identifying system bottlenecks, diagnosing failures, and ensuring the overall health of microservices-based architectures.

Alauda Service Mesh integrates with multiple observability components to deliver a unified telemetry solution. These components operate collectively to support telemetry data collection, storage, analysis, and presentation.

- **Monitoring components**
  Leverages Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics for metrics collection and Alertmanager for alerting.

- **Distributed Tracing Platform**
  Provides end-to-end distributed tracing capabilities using components such as Jaeger and OpenTelemetry.

- **Alauda Build of Kiali**
  Offers visualization and operational insights into the service mesh, including real-time traffic topology, configuration validation, and tracing integration.
